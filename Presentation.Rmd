## Learning Outcomes


1.  You will be able to understand when crosses don't conform to Mendelian Inheritance

--

2.  You will be able to analyze monohybrid crosses for incomplete dominance & co-dominance

--

3.  You will be able to describe complex patterns of inheritance involving epistasis

---

# Mendelian Inheritance

** `a quick` recap**

1. `Law of dominance & uniformity`: some alleles are dominant, while others are recessive.

--

2. `Law of segregation`: Gametes only carry one allele for each gene. 

--
3. `Law of independent assortment`: Genes of different traits sort independently.
